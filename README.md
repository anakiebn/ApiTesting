# Testing API

This is a research project, utilizing all public API's I could find. The aim is to later integrate all these to my secret app I'll be developing later.

So far, I have integrated number verifier, youtube transcript,Google news, image  and search APIs provided by SerpAPI.

The limitations that came with these APIs such as the number of endpoints you can hit inspired me to scrap these services my self and create my own APIs.
